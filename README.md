# SNAKE VS MOUSE

<a href="https://sara5491.github.io/snakevsmouse/">Play the game</a>
'Snake vs Mouse' is an online game inspired by the classic 'Snake' video game where the user tries to eat as much 'food' as they can without running into the tail of the snake. It is a very simple concept but very addictive!

The idea is to guide the snake using the arrows on a keyboard or the controls on the screen to try and eat as many 'mice'
as possible. Each time a mouse is eaten, the snake grows longer and a point is scored.

## TABLE OF CONTENTS

## PLANNING
### Project Goals
The aim is to create an interactive, fun game that is easy to play. It should be enjoyable so players want to play it
again and again.

### User Goals
The game should be simple enough that it can be played during a short period e.g. while in a doctor's waiting room or on a work break. It should entice the user to keep coming back to it, to try and beat their high score.

### User Stories
- As a user I want to immediately understand how to play the game.
- As a user I want to be able to see my progress (via scores).
- As a user I want to be able to complete the game within a short time frame.
- As a user I want to view game instructions, if necessary.
- As a user I want to play the game on a mobile phone or computer.
- As a user I want to play a simple and straightforward game.
