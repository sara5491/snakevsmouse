# SNAKE VS MOUSE

<a href="https://sara5491.github.io/snakevsmouse/">Play the game</a>
'Snake vs Mouse' is an online game inspired by the classic 'Snake' video game where the user tries to eat as much 'food' as they can without running into the tail of the snake. It is a very simple concept but very addictive!

The idea is to guide the snake using the arrows on a keyboard or the controls on the screen to try and eat as many 'mice'
as possible. Each time a mouse is eaten, the snake grows longer and a point is scored.

## TABLE OF CONTENTS

## PLANNING
### Project Goals
The aim is to create an interactive, fun game that is easy to play. It should be enjoyable so players want to play it
again and again.

### User Goals
The game should be simple enough that it can be played during a short period e.g. while in a doctor's waiting room or on a work break. It should entice the user to keep coming back to it, to try and beat their high score.

### User Stories
- As a user I want to immediately understand how to play the game.
- As a user I want to be able to see my progress (via scores).
- As a user I want to be able to complete the game within a short time frame.
- As a user I want to view game instructions, if necessary.
- As a user I want to play the game on a mobile phone or computer.
- As a user I want to play a simple and straightforward game.

### Design Goals
I wanted to create a game that is easy to use, can be played on multiple devices, has simple controls and is designed with complementary colours.

### Design Choices
#### Layout
- The game area is in the centre of the page, with the 'snake' displayed as green cells and the 'food' displayed as an image of a mouse.
- The player's current score, their high score, the audio player button and the instructions are clearly shown above the game area.
- The instructions open in a container when the ? icon is clicked on.
- Arrows which can be used to control the snake on both computers and mobile devices are displayed underneath the game area.
- A pause button is displayed alongside the arrow controls. The game can also be paused (and started again) by pressing the spacebar.
- A footer with social media links is shown at the bottom of the page on all devices.
- A lilac half-oval shape is the main feature of the background which gives the page more depth.
